# The "x_X"
## _Where we are going we don't need extrsuions_

The "x_X" initiative emerged from trying to source aluminum extrusions one day. Due to crazy prices, I looked into printing extrsuion as a viable alternative. Although the initial experiment failed, continued research and development led to the current offering.


## The goal:

- Use as many spare parts as I can
- Make sure that any parts needed can be easily sourced
- Make all the parts as easy as possible to print
- Make all designs fully open source
- Make it as scalable and modular as possible


## Build Of Materials:

- (work in progress)

## Instructions:
